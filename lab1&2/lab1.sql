The difference between a view and a table is that views are definitions built on top of 
other tables (or views), and do not hold data themselves. If data is changing in the underlying 
table, the same change is reflected in the view. A view can be built on top of a single table 
or multiple tables. It can also be built on top of another view.

b) Explain what you did and why.
*/

/*
Before we started with this part of the task, we created a detailed overview of the ER model.
The starting point is the Supplier table from where we examined direct connections. 
We found out that there is no entry between Supplier and Supply. Accordingly, we do not 
need to look at the Supply and Parts table for this part of the task any further. 
However, if we take a closer look at the City, Item and Sale tables, we can see that there 
are relationships between them and the supplier.

If we want to delete only one tuple from a table, this generates an error, because there are 
further connections to other tables (as already explained). 
Therefore we proceeded step by step and deleted the tuple first in jbsale, then in 
jbitem and finally in jbsupplier. This task is given with restriction, only "Los Angeles" 
may be used as constant. Therefore we create a large table with several joins statements.
